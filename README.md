# 20 Valid Parenthesis.cpp
A solution to problem #20 on leetcode. This is the first solution I came up with, and it solves for all test cases. Particularly, it solves for further test cases such as s="((((({{(([]))}})))))" and s="{([])}" as it will iterate backward to find the last unused operator.
